                    Carrie is one of my favorite Stephen King books, and I found the similarities between the two books of young people with telekinesis powers really exciting. I haven't read a ton of books by King, but the ones I have read are some of my favorites. 
                    The Instiute was a fun read, but I don't know if it is one of my favorites. Only because I felt the plot was a little predictable. I was expecting some more twists and turns but felt sometimes things just worked out too well for Luke. I understand that
                    the lack of security and making sure things were kept up with certain aspects of the _institute_ were part of the reason the kids were able to escape, but I felt like it was a little too easy. King's storytelling is always an exciting ride though, so I was constantly excited 
                    when I got a chance to read more. The character development was great and the details of certain situations were really well done. But a couple things that bothered me was Tim being in the story a ton at the beginning but only coming back in towards the end. 
                    I had to literally go back to the beginning of the book to remind myself that this was the same person that was introduced at the beginning. So though I don't find it one of my favorites by King, I still really enjoyed it and will probably read it again in the future
                    (somthing I do a lot of with Stephen King Novels).

                    Very good overview of the Elon Musk Twitter takeover. It reads like a ficional thriller, but it's all true (if you trust the author which I have no reason not too). I remember during my last fews months on Twitter before Elon <i>ruined</i>
                    it, I followed Ester Crawford's journey and it was exciting to see more behind the scenes of her involvement when Elon took over. I hope there is a sequel to this book that continues
                    to cover how the company, formally known as Twitter, is doing today. This book reminds me of another book, which is a favorite of mine, called <i>Hatching Twitter</i> by Nick Bilton.
                    Which is interesting because it covers the early days of Twitter and how it was built, and this book covers how Elon pretty much changed everything the original founders intended the company to be.

                    After rewatching the HBO series, I decided to <i>finally</i> read the book. It was a great read, but I have to say the show is much better only because the book only used in Season 1 of the series. The book is also very different then show, in 
                    that characters and how they are related is very different. You also don't get as much of a satisfying conclusion as you do in the show. The book defintely covers more of each character and how they are dealing with being "leftover" but overall I think
                    the book is really well written and gave me more perspective of the characters that makes me appreciate the show even more.

                    What a hard read. Jake Tapper and Alex Thiompson do a great job covering the Biden administration and how it diificult it was at Biden's age to be president, let alone try and run for re-election. It was not only frustrating but heartbreaking as well. I do feel like the book
                    jumps around a lot and it is sometimes hard to follow certain events since some are broken out over multiple chapters that are spread out throughout the book. Overall it was a good read and kept me engaged, but I honestly came to feel to have a bit more empathy towards Biden
                    then I did before. Not that I am letting him off the hook, but I think he was misguided by people who were close and loved him, which ended up leaving his legacy somewhat tarnished.

                    I really enjoy Ezra Klein and look forward to reading his opinion pieces in the New York Times. So I was even more excited to read his new book that he co-wrote with Derek Thompson, but I was overall not very convinced by the Abundance movement after reading this book.
                    I think the book covers some points that we need to be better about when it comes to making our society better using technology and removing barriers, like certain over reuglations, but I don't know if this book covered enough to convince me. I think there are a lot more barriers
                    stopping states like California from be able to build more housing and make it more affordable, but I think the book does a good job of covering some of the issues that we face today.
